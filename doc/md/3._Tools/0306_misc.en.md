# Miscellaneous Tools

## timvis scripts

Scripts `timvis.gmt` and `timvis_abs.gmt` are used to visualize the elapsed time of the
computation obtained with the input parameter `stopwatch_mode = .true.`
by using GMT versions 5 or later.

## Geographic Coordinate Conversion

The Fortran programs `ll2xy.x` and `xy2ll.x` can project and inversely
project the geographic and Cartesian coordinates with the same algorithm
as `OpenSWPC`. These tools are provided for `OpenSWPC` version 3.0 or
later.


## `wvconv.x`: a waveform conversion tool from 2D to 3D

**New in version 5.2**

is a tool to convert 2D simulation results into 3D-simulation-equivalent seismic waveforms.

Let us denote the 3D seismic waveform from a point source located at $(\xi, \eta, \zeta)$ as $V_{3D}(\xi, \eta, \zeta, t)$. The 2D simulation result from a point source at $(\xi, \zeta)$ can be expressed by line integral with respect to y-direction as 

$$
\begin{align}
V_{2D}(\xi, \zeta, t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty V_{3D}(\xi, \eta, \zeta, t) d \eta. 
\end{align}
$$

The inverse transformation can be written as [^1]

$$
\begin{align}
    V_{3D}(\xi, \eta=0, \zeta, t) = \frac{1}{\pi} 
    \sqrt{\frac{1}{2 R v}} 
    \frac{d}{dt}
    \left[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} \ast V_{2D}(\xi, \zeta, t) \right], 
\end{align}
$$

where $R$ is a propagation distance, and $V$ is a seismic velocity at each phase appeared in the waveform. The simbol $\ast$ denotes convolution integral.

The tool `wvconv.x` evaluate this translation by frequency-domain calculation with assumptions that $R$ and $V$ are both constant: 

$$
\begin{align}
    & \widetilde{V}_{2D} (\xi, \zeta, f) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty 
    V_{2D} (\xi, \zeta, f) e^{i 2 \pi f t} dt 
    \\
    & V_{3D}(\xi, \eta=0, \zeta, t) = 
    \int_{-\infty}^\infty     \sqrt{-\frac{i f}{Rv}}
    \widetilde{V}_{2D} (\xi, \zeta, f)
    e^{-i 2 \pi f t} d f. 
\end{align}
$$

In the calculation, $R$ is assuumed to be a straight line between the source and the receiver. The value of $v$ can be given as a parameter, but by default it is calculated assuming $v=4000$ m/s.


#### Usage: 

```
wvconv.x in.sac out.sac (V0)
     in.sac: input SAC file (must be 2D simulation output)
     out.sac: output SAC filename
     V0 (optional): assumed average velocity in m/s unit. Default is 4000 m/s
```

As an example, the following figure shows a comparison between the waveform calculated with the P-SV 2D code in the 1D structure of `example/lhm.dat` and converted by `wvconv.x` ($V=4000$ m/s) and the result of 3D calculation with the same structure.

!!! Quote "Figure"
    ![](../fig/wvconv.png)
    Comparison of 3D simulation results (gray curve) and 2D P-SV simulation results converted by `wvconv.x` (red curve).

Since the velocity of the seismic phase is assumed to be 4000 m/s, the amplitudes of the P-wave and subsequent surface wave phases are slightly different, but in general, the waveforms are in very good agreement. If the comparison is made without `wvconv.x`, the amplitudes and shapes of the waveforms are completely different.

!!! Warning
    `wvconv.x` is a very new code introduced in Version 5.2, and might contain bug(s). Please use it with caution.
