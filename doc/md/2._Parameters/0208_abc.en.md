# Absorbing Boundary Conditions

Users can choose an absorbing boundary condition from the auxiliary
differential equation, the complex frequency-shifted perfectly matched
layer (ADE CFS-PML; Zhang et al., 2010[^Zhang2010]）, and Cerjan's sponge condition
(Cerjan et al., 1985[^Cerjan1985]).0

The entire computational domain is separated into interior and exterior
regions by the thickness of the absorber `na`, as shown in the following figure.

    Schematic of the definition of the absorber region. The red dotted line indicates the location of `kbeg_a(I,J)`.

Because this program assumes the existence of a free surface and ignores acoustic waves in the air
column, the waves in the top boundary will not be absorbed. At a given
horizontal grid location `(I,J)`, the depth grid deeper than `kbeg_a`
will be used as the attenuator.

For computational efficiency in the PML boundary condition, `OpenSWPC`
does not solve the viscoelastic constitutive equation in the absorber.
Note that, in the case of a medium having very small $Q$ values, this
may lead to a velocity gap between the interior and exterior regions due
to physical dispersion.

For Cerjan's absorbing condition, the parameters suggested by
[@Cerjan:1985uz] are embedded in the source code. However, these
parameters are scaled according to the width of the absorber `na`.

The PML absorber is usually superior to the Cerjan's sponge condition in its
efficiency in avoiding artificial reflection from the boundaries.
However, PML occasionally results in numerical instabilities,
particularly for a medium with a strong velocity contrast and after
several time steps. In case if such instability occurs, the following empirical remedies might work: 

- Slightly change the computational area by changing `clon` and `clat`, or `nx` and `ny`
- Eliminate very-low velocity layers in the absorber region by setting `stabilize_pml = .true.` 
- Elongate the rise time of the source time function to reduce high-frequency wave components. 

The Cerjan's sponge always gives a very stable result.



!!! Info "Parameters"

    **`abc_type`**
    : Type of the absorbing boundary condition. Choose from `’pml’` or
    `’cerjan’`.

    **`na`**
    : Thickness of the absorbing layer in numbers of grids. Usually, 10-20
    grids are chosen.

    **`stabilize_pml`**
    : The low velocity layer is removed if this flag is `.true.`, to
    stabilize PML. This option may increase the amplitude or artificial reflection as a side effect. 

<!---
    **`fullspace_mode`** (new in version 5.2)
    : Apply the absorbing boundary condition at the lower end of the $z$-axis. Usually this is not necessary as there is a air (vacuum) column at the shallowmost portion. This option may be useful for simulating wave propagation in full-space without surface. Note that most of the ready-made velocity structure assumes the existance of the free surface. One may have to prepare the one's own velocity structure (by modifying the `user` velocity model code) to fully utilize this mode. 
    
!!! Caution
    Fullspace mode fully works after version 5.2. Fullspace mode works only in 2D codes between Versions 5.0 and 5.1.

!!! Caution
    The `fullspace_mode` implemented in Version 5.0 -- 5.1 has been temporarily disabled because it was found to cause trouble in certain environments even when the mode was not set. The cause of the trouble is being investigated.
