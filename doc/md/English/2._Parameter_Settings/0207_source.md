## Moment Rate Function 

This section describes the moment rate functions, $\dot{M}(t)$, that can
be used in `OpenSWPC` by choosing the parameter `stftype`. In the
following, all moment rate functions have a duration (or characteristic
time) $T_R$ and are normalized so that the total moment is $1$.


- Box-car function (`boxcar`)

\begin{align}
   \dot{m}^ R \left(t\right) &=
    \frac{1}{T_R} 
  & \begin{array}{r} ( 0 \le t \le T_R) \\ \end{array}
\end{align}

- Triangle function (`triangle`)

\begin{align}
\dot{m}^ T \left(t\right)  = 
\begin{cases}
4t/T_R^2 & ( 0 \le t \le T_R/2 ) \\
-4(t-T_R)/T_R^2 & ( T_R/2 < t \le T_R )
\end{cases}
\end{align}
 
- Herrmann function (`herrmann`)

\begin{align}
\dot{m}^ H \left(t\right) =
\begin{cases}
16 t^2 / T_R^3 & ( 0 \le t \le T_R/4  ) \\
-2 ( 8 t^2 - 8 t T_R + T_R^2 ) / T_R^3  & ( T_R/4 < t \le 3T_R/4  ) \\
16 \left( t - T_R \right)^2 / T_R^3 &  (3T_R/4 < t \le T_R  )
\end{cases}
\end{align}

- Cosine function (`cosine`)

\begin{align}
\dot{m}^ C \left(t\right) =
\frac{1}{T_R} \left[ 1 - \cos \left(\frac{2 \pi t}{T_R} \right) \right]
\quad ( 0 \le t \le T_R) 
\end{align}

- Küpper wavelet (`kupper`)

\begin{align}
  \dot{m}^K \left( t \right ) &= 
  \frac{3 \pi}{4 T_R} \sin^3\left( \frac{\pi t}{T_R} \right) 
  \quad ( 0 \le t \le T_R) 
\end{align}


- t-exp type function (`texp`)

\begin{align}
  \dot{m}^{E} \left( t \right) &= \frac{(2 \pi)^2 t}{T_R^2} \exp\left[ - \frac{ 2 \pi t}{T_R}\right]
  \quad ( 0 \le t ) 
\end{align}


The next figure shows each moment rate function and its Fourier spectrum.

    Moment rate functions $\dot{M}(t)$ (left) and their Fourier spectra (right). 

The moment rate
functions have a roll off of $f^{-1}$--$f^{-4}$ at frequencies of
$f\gg 1/T_R$. To avoid numerical dispersion, the source spectrum should
be sufficiently small at the highest target frequency. As this maximum
frequency, we adopt $f_\text{max}=2/T_R$ for all types of source time
functions (the red dotted line in the figure.If the
parameter is appropriately set so that numerical dispersion does not
occur at frequencies below $f_\text{max}$, the result should not be
contaminated by numerical dispersion. In addition, the uppermost
frequency, where the spectrum response of the source time function
becomes flat in the frequency domain, is approximately $f \le 1/(2 T_R)$
(the blue dotted line in the figure. 


## Moment Tensor Source

The source mechanisms of the faulting are given by a six-component
moment tensor or by three parameters of a double couple source
(`strike`, `dip`, `rake`). The source locations can be given either by
their computational or geographical coordinates. The size of the earthquake can be described by seismic moment $M_0$ or moment magnitude $M_W$ or fault slip $D$ & area $S$. 
In total, there are
ten possible formats to describe the source. In the program, sources are given as a
stress-drop source by using the moment rate function. The moment rate
function is chosen from the given six functions. They require
parameters in the source list file for their starting time $T_0$,
duration $T_R$, and total moment $M_0$.

`OpenSWPC` can accept multiple point sources as multiple lines in the
source list file. There is no fixed limit to the number of sources (in
practice, this is determined by the memory size). By gradually changing
the starting time and source location, a finite fault rupture can be
mimicked. In the source list file, lines starting with `#` will be
ignored. By setting `sdep_fit`, the source depth can be changed so that
it fits the medium's velocity boundary. In this case, the depth in the
source list file will be ignored. The layer number should be specified
in the `fn_grd` or `fn_grd_rmed` list files.

!!! Info "Parameters"
    **`stf_format`**
    : Format of the source list file. Choose from the following six candidates. 

        -  `'xym0ij'` :  $x$, $y$, $z$, $T_0$, $T_R$, $M_0$, $m_{xx}$, $m_{yy}$,  $m_{zz}$,  $m_{yz}$, $m_{xz}$, $m_{xy}$    
        -  `'xym0dc'`  :  $x$, $y$, $z$, $T_0$, $T_R$, $M_0$,  strike, dip, rake  

        -  `'llm0ij'`   : lon, lat, $z$, $T_0$, $T_R$, $M_0$, $m_{xx}$, $m_{yy}$,  $m_{zz}$, $m_{yz}$, $m_{xz}$, $m_{xy}$  

        - `'llm0dc'`  :  lon, lat, $z$, $T_0$, $T_R$, $M_0$, strike, dip, rake  

        - `'xymwij'`   :  $x$, $y$, $z$, $T_0$, $T_R$, $M_W$,  $m_{xx}$, $m_{yy}$, $m_{zz}$, $m_{yz}$, $m_{xz}$, $m_{xy}$  

        - `'xymwdc'` :  $x$, $y$, $z$, $T_0$, $T_R$, $M_W$, strike, dip, rake  

        - `'llmwij'`  : lon, lat, $z$, $T_0$, $T_R$, $M_W$, $m_{xx}$, $m_{yy}$, $m_{zz}$, $m_{yz}$,  $m_{xz}$,  $m_{xy}$  

        -  `'llmwdc'`  : lon, lat, $z$, $T_0$, $T_R$, $M_W$, strike, dip, rake
  
        - `'lldsdc'` : lon, lat, $z$, $T_0$, $T_R$, $D$, $S$, strike, dip, rake
  
        - `'xydsdc'` : $x$, $y$, $z$, $T_0$, $T_R$, $D$, $S$, strike, dip, rake

        The unit of each variables are [km] for $x$, $y$, $z$, [Nm] for $M_0$ and $m_{ij}$, [s] for $T_0$ and $T_R$, [degree] for all parameters describing angles, [m] for slip $D$ and [m${}^2$] for area $S$. 

    ** `stftype`**
    : Choice of the source time function. Select from `'boxcar'`,
    `'triangle'`, `'herrmann'`, `'kupper'`, `'cosine'`, and `'texp'`.

    ** `fn_stf`**
    : Filename of the source list.

    ** `sdep_fit` **
    : Flag to fit the source depth to the velocity discontinuity. 
    `'asis'`: do not fit (default). `'bd{i}'`(i=1,2,$\cdots$9): fits to
    the `i`-th boundary specified in the rightmost column of
    `fn_grdlst`.

## Body Force Mode

A body force source can be used instead of a moment tensor source. In
this mode, the three-component force vector ($f_x$, $f_y$, $f_z$) should
be specified. The force vector is assumed to have a bell-shaped source
time function, as in the case of the moment tensor source. Although
there is no restriction on the number of body force elements, it is not
possible to use both a moment tensor and a body force at the same time.


!!! Info "Parameters"
    **`bf_mode`**
    :   Flag for the body force mode. If this is `.true.`, the following
    parameters are used for the body force and the moment tensor source
    is ignored.

    **`stf_format`**
    :  Format of the source file. Select from `'xy'` or `'ll'`. Note that the source file format is different from that for the moment tensor. 

        -  `'xy'`:    x,    y,     z,   $T_0$ ,  $T_R$ ,  $f_x$,   $f_y$,   $f_z$
        
        -  `'ll'`:   lon,    lat ,  z,   $T_0$,   $T_R$ ,  $f_x$,   $f_y$ ,  $f_z$

    **`stftype`**
    : Choice of the source time function. Same as the case with a moment
    tensor source.

    **`fn_stf`**
    : Filename of the source list file.

    **`sdep_fit`**
    : Flag to fit the source depth to a specified velocity discontinuity.
    Same as the case with a moment tensor source.


## Plane Wave Mode


A plane wave incident from the bottom can be used as an input source
instead of the moment tensor or body force sources. In `OpenSWPC`, plane
wave incidence is achieved by setting the velocity vector and stress
tensor components based on the analytic solution of a plane wave
propagating upward as the initial condition.

The specification of the initial conditions includes the depth of the
initial plane wave (`pw_ztop`) and its characteristic length (`pw_zlen`;
corresponding to the wavelength), the strike and dip angle of the plane
wave (`pw_strike`, `pw_dip`), and the polarization direction (rake
angle) in the case of an S-wave (`pw_rake`). See the next figure for the geometry. 

!!! Quote "Figure"
    ![](../../fig/pw_mode_coord.png)
    Geometry of the plane wave specification. (Left) The specification of the uppermost plane and the polarization direction. (Right) The depth cross section of the initial plane wave.

The definitions of the
strike, dip, and rake parameters follow those of the earthquake source
fault geometry of Aki and Richards (2002[^Aki2002]). For three-dimensional space,
`pw_strike=0` results in the plane dip toward the $y$-direction (east
for `phi=0`). A rake angle of `pw_rake=0`${}^\circ$ or
`pw_rake=180`${}^\circ$ will result in pure SH waves whose polarization
is parallel to the free surface.

The initial plane wave occupies a depth range of `pw_zlen` (km) starting
at depths of $z=$`pw_ztop` at the center of the horizontal coordinate.
The depth dependence of the wave amplitude is determined by the source
time functions used in the moment rate function as a function of space. 
Via the definition of the source time
function, the integration of the initial plane wave along the
propagation direction will be normalized to 1.


!!! Info "Parameters"
    **`pw_mode`**
    : 
    Flag to use the plane-wave mode. If it is `.true.`, all point-source
    locations (body force or moment tensor source) will be ignored.

    **`pw_ztop`**
    :    
    $z$-value of the top of the initial plane wave at $x=y=0$.

    **`pw_zlen`**
    :   
    Characteristic spatial scale of the initial plane wave.

    **`pw_ps`**
    :    
    Plane wave type. Choose from `'p'` or `'s'`

    **`pw_strike`**
    : 
    Strike direction of initial plane wave in degrees measured from the $x$-axis.

    **`pw_dip`**
    :    
    Dip angle of the initial plane wave in degrees. The initial plane wave propagates vertically if this angle is zero.

    **`pw_rake`**
    :    
    Polarization direction of initial plane S-wave in degrees measured from the horizontal plane.

    **`stftype`**
    :  
    Source time function type. Same as the cases with the moment tensor
    or body force sources.

The use of the PML absorbing boundary condition (`abc_type='pml'`; see [this section](0208_abc.md) for details) is
strongly recommended for the case of plane wave incidence. The simple
Cerjan's (`abc_type='cerjan'`) condition always causes significant
contamination by artificial reflections.

    (green) for the case of vertical plane S-wave incidence with (a)
    Cerjan's condition and (b) PML boundary
    conditions.


Even when using the PML boundary, the tilted plane wave incidence (with
nonzero `pw_dip` angle) causes some amount of artificial reflections. It
is highly recommended that the boundary effect be confirmed with
snapshot visualization when using this plane wave mode.
