# Miscellaneous Tools

## timvis scripts

Scripts `timvis.gmt` and `timvis_abs.gmt` are used to visualize the elapsed time of the
computation obtained with the input parameter `stopwatch_mode = .true.`
by using GMT versions 5 or later.

## Geographic Coordinate Conversion

The Fortran programs `ll2xy.x` and `xy2ll.x` can project and inversely
project the geographic and Cartesian coordinates with the same algorithm
as `OpenSWPC`. These tools are provided for `OpenSWPC` version 3.0 or
later.
