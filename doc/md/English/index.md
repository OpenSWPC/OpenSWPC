## Description

This software simulate seismic wave propagation by solving equations of motion with constitutive equations of linear elastic/viscoelastic medium by finite difference method (FDM) under message passing interface (MPI) environment in 3D and 2D (P-SV or SH) media.

This package also provides a set of tools for visualizing/converting simulation output.
